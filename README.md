# Cat vs. No Cat Image Recognition Model

This project utilizes the Teachable Machine platform to create a simple image classification model that classifies images into two categories: "Cat" and "No Cat." We then export the model and use it in a Python script running on Google Colab.

## Requirements

- A web browser to access Teachable Machine and Google Colab
- Basic understanding of Python programming
- TensorFlow library (automatically handled in Google Colab)

## Steps to Create and Use the Model

### 1. Train the Model
we create two classes then upload images for both.

### 2. Export the Model

### 3.we run the code in google collab to predicte

### 4. Implement the Prediction Script

1. Install TensorFlow:
   - Install TensorFlow in your Colab environment.

2. Load the Model and Class Labels:
   - Load the Keras model and class labels using the appropriate code.

3. Create a Prediction Function:
   - Write a function that takes an input image and predicts its class.

4. Test the Model:
   - Upload a test image and use the prediction function to classify it.
